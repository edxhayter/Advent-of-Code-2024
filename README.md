# Advent of Code

## Day 1

### Data Input
Advent of code provided a static data set of two columns seperated by 3 spaces. I added column headers, this was a good opportunity to learn that you can customize the .csv seperator in the dbt_project.yml or a .yml file in the seeds directory. I therefore specified that the delimeter was three spaces.
